## 🔧 **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### **Why Multiple Specialized Flows Over Single Monolithic Flow?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each data type has distinct generation logic and requirements
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify individual workflows
- **Performance Optimization**: Targeted processing for specific data types
- **Scalability**: Individual flows can be enhanced independently

### **Why Flow Over Pure Apex?**
- **Low-Code Maintenance**: Business users can modify processes without code changes
- **Visual Process Management**: Clear workflow visualization and debugging across all data types
- **Native AI Integration**: Built-in connectors for prompt templates
- **Error Handling**: Declarative exception management with user-friendly messaging

### **Why JSON Over Direct Object Mapping?**
- **Flexibility**: AI can generate variable numbers of records per request across all data types
- **Error Resilience**: Malformed responses don't break entire process
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new properties without code changes
- **Debugging**: Human-readable format for troubleshooting AI responses
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Standard format works across Contact, Email, and Activity generation

### **Why Specialized Prompt Templates Over Generic Templates?**
- **Data Type Optimization**: Each template optimized for specific record types and business logic
- **Context Awareness**: Contact prompts focus on professional profiles, email prompts on communication patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Specialized prompts generate higher quality, more realistic data
- **Version Control**: Template changes can be managed through metadata independently
- **Governance**: Centralized prompt management with data-type-specific approval workflows

### **Why Apex Classes for JSON Processing?**
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed classes prevent runtime errors during deserialization
- **Business Logic**: Complex relationship mapping and validation logic
- **Performance**: Efficient bulk processing for multiple records
- **Error Handling**: Granular exception management for different data types

## 📊 **Performance Architecture**

### **Multi-Workflow Scalability Considerations**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple data types can be generated simultaneously
- **Batch Processing**: Creates multiple records of each type in single DML operations
- **Governor Limit Awareness**: Each workflow designed within Salesforce execution limits
- **Async Processing**: Individual flows can be enhanced with Platform Events for high-volume scenarios
- **Resource Isolation**: Each data type has independent resource consumption

### **Cross-Pipeline Efficiency Optimizations**
- **Single AI Call Per Data Type**: One prompt generates all requested records of each type
- **Minimal Database Queries**: Efficient record retrieval and creation across all workflows
- **JSON Streaming**: Large datasets processed without memory constraints
- **Context Reuse**: Account/Opportunity context shared across related workflows
- **Intelligent Caching**: Business context cached for related generation requests

### **Data Type Specific Performance**
- **Contact Generation**: Optimized for bulk contact creation with address validation
- **Email Generation**: Thread management and relationship linking optimized for scale
- **Activity Generation**: Chronological ordering and relationship creation optimized

## 🎭 **User Experience Architecture**
