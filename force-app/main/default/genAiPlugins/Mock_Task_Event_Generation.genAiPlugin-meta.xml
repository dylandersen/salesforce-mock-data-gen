        <description>When users request activity generation for any record, always use the Generate_Task_Event_Data action. Extract the record ID from context, the number of activities from the user&apos;s request (e.g., &quot;5 activities&quot;, &quot;3 tasks&quot;, &quot;8 events&quot;), and the industry type (e.g., &quot;automotive&quot;, &quot;healthcare&quot;, &quot;fintech&quot;). Never attempt to create activities manually.</description>
